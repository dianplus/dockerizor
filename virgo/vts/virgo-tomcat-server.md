[Virgo][Virgo] from [EclipseRT][EclipseRT] is a completely module-based Java application server that is designed to run enterprise Java applications and Spring-powered applications with a high degree of flexibility and reliability. It offers a simple yet comprehensive platform to develop, deploy, and service enterprise Java applications.

# Build your Docker image

To create an application based on this image you can simply drop your application into the ``pickup`` folder.
The following Dockerfile would add your application bundle to the Docker container:

	FROM dianplus/virgo-tomcat-server

	ADD my-app.jar /home/virgo/pickup/

Change into the directory that contains your Dockerfile and build your image.

    docker build .

# Running the Container

The following command starts the Virgo Server for Apache Tomcat in a Docker container and exposes the port ``8080``.

    docker run -it --rm --name="virgo-tomcat-server" --publish=8080:8080 -t dianplus/virgo-tomcat-server:latest

# Accessing your Web Application

The context path of the application is specified in the OSGi metadata of your application bundle.

# Customize the Virgo Container

The Virgo container is built with [Dockerizer][Dockerizor]:

	dockerizor {
		virgoFlavour = 'VTS'
		removeAdminConsole = true
		removeSplash = true

		virgoVersion = 'latest'
		imageName = 'virgo-tomcat-server'
	}

*Note:* The Admin Console and the Splash screen have been removed from the container.
